You have been warned.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nlobsterpie gets information from certain environment variables:\r\n\r\n* `LB_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY` - twitter consumer key\r\n* `LB_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET` - twitter consumer secret\r\n* `LB_TWITTER_ACCESS_KEY` - twitter access token\r\n* `LB_TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET` - twitter access secret\r\n* `LB_DATABASE_PATH` - the path to the sqlite database used to store \r\npreviously posted stories.\r\n\r\nAs lobsterpie is the only user running on the application, I've just used\r\nTwitter's OAuth tool to pre-generate the requisite tokens and secrets.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n0. You will first need to set up the environment. I do this with a script\r\ncalled `env.sh` that I source into the environment before running the bot.\r\n0. Create the database using `dbtool.py create`.\r\n0. Run the bot (it requires no arguments).\r\n0. If you have to shutdown the bot (i.e. to migrate it to another host),\r\nyou can call `dbtool.py dump` to dump the database as a Python hash. This \r\nhas the benefit of allowing you to play with the entries and use them for \r\ntesting.\r\n0. A dumpfile can be restored with `dbtool.py restore`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nlobsterpie is released under an ISC license:\r\n\r\n    THE ISC LICENSE:\r\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    \r\n    the ISC license:\r\n    Copyright (c) 2011, 2012 Kyle Isom <kyle@tyrfingr.is>\r\n    \r\n    Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any\r\n    purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above \r\n    copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\r\n    \r\n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES\r\n    WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.
